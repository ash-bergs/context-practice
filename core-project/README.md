This is a Whose Line is it Anyway project. Nothing matters, and none of the components really do anything. 

I built this project to pratice using the React Context API as the docs recommend: To control a piece of global state that impacts every other component 

In this project those things are language & a color theme 

## Stage One: 

The app is built using class components - styles are built externally in JSS, imported in and used in unison with the Material UI library. 

## Stage Two: 

The app is refactored to use function components and hooks! The styles will still be external, but predictably a lot will be learned. 

The code will be littered with comments. I apologize if you try to read them.
